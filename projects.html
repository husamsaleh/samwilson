      <h2>Automated payroll system with GPS tracking and image capture</h2>
      <p>
        This system is a combination of web as well as android application where
        the user will be using the android application and admin as well as HR
        will work with web application. This application is meant for field work
        users. The user will have this application in his android phone, when
        the user will login to the system his image will be captured and his GPS
        location will be send to the admin where admin will view image and GPS
        location in web application. After Login, GPS location of the employee
        will be tracked automatically by the system and send to the admin after
        every 5 minutes .When user logout the system again the image will be
        captured as well as GPS location will be send to the admin. In order to
        keep track of the attendance as well as payroll of the field work
        people, this system plays a major role. The role of the admin is to add
        new employee by entering his personal details and admin will provide the
        employee with identity number and password to the user so that he can
        access the application in his android phone. Admin can view the GPS
        location of the employee by entering Employee Identity Number as well as
        Date. Admin can check the salary of the particular employee by entering
        date and employee ID. Admin can view latitude and longitude of the GPS
        location sent by the employee. Admin can change the password of the
        employee. When the HR login to the system he can check the GPS location
        of the employee by entering employee ID and date. HR can check salary of
        the particular employee by entering employee identity number and date.
        This application helps admin and hr to easily check the salary of the
        employee. Since GPS location of the employee is tracked, so employee
        will not attempt to add proxy attendance.

      <h2>Data leakage detection system</h2>
      <p>
        Data leakage detection techniques are built for users to track if data
        has been leaked and the trace the sources of data leakage. Many times we
        come across cases where leaked data is found at unauthorized places. For
        example we may find sensitive data stored on an unauthorized laptop or
        website. At such a time it becomes important to trace the source of data
        leakage. For this purpose we propose an improved data leakage detection
        technique to trace back sources of unauthorized leakage by using a
        strategy of data allocation across various agents. The strategy allows
        user to transfer data to users by considering receivers as agents who
        are allocated data along with some id based undetectable alterations.
        These alterations allow our system to trace back the source of leaked
        data as soon as it is found on any unauthorized sources. In this system
        we propose to indentify data leakages by storing data as per agents. Our
        system is designed for detection of data in (.txt,.jpg &.bmp) formats.

      <h2>Credit card fraud detection</h2>
      <p>
        The credit card fraud detection features uses user behavior and location
        scanning to check for unusual patterns. These patterns include user
        characteristics such as user spending patterns as well as usual user
        geographic locations to verify his identity. If any unusual pattern is
        detected, the system requires revivification. The system analyses user
        credit card data for various characteristics. These characteristics
        include user country, usual spending procedures. Based upon previous
        data of that user the system recognizes unusual patterns in the payment
        procedure. So now the system may require the user to login again or even
        block the user for more than 3 invalid attempts. Core Features: The
        system stores previous transaction patterns for each user. Based upon
        the user spending ability and even country, it calculates userâ€™s
        characteristics. More than 20 -30 %deviation of users
        transaction(spending history and operating country) is considered as an
        invalid attempt and system takes action.
